      <h1>Welcome to Damien's Page</h1>
        This web page has a collection of programs that I wrote in my csc106 corse at the University of Rhoad Island. 
            <br>This is the first web page I have built but and I look forwadrd to seeing what I will do with it.<br>
        <br> I think this is a great project to start off the year and something that was not to hard. I thought builing</br>
    <br> a website would be alot more complex. But I am glad to know it was not. It is now a skill I can happly say I have</br> 
        <h2>Thanks!</h2>
